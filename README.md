# Rock-Paper-Scissors: Elements of Nature

### Abstract:
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built a fully playable web-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch! I built the game so that one person can play against the computer, and I built it to reset after seven rounds. You can play the classic version with three fighter choices, or the deluxe game, which includes five fighter choices, and even toggle between the class and deluxe. Instead of rock, paper, scissors, I chose an Elements of Nature theme that includes earth, water, fire, wind, and my adorable cat, Otis!

### Context:
Rock-Paper-Scissors was completed during our fifth week at Turing and served as the final capstone project for Mod 1. We were given a full week to complete this project while balancing classes, professional development, other assignments, and our final assessment. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo-v2.html).
